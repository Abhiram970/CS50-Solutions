        <h4>Elon Musk warns drivers not to trust new "full self-driving" update.</h4>
        <h6>"Please be paranoid."</h6></center>
        <br>
        <p>Tesla has finally started to roll out the latest version of its “Full Self-Driving”
        beta, which is its long-awaited assisted driving update that gives Teslas the ability
        to automatically change lanes and obey traffic lights and stop signs.</p>
        <p>That’s an exciting development on Tesla’s journey toward vehicles that are self-driving
        in technological capacity rather than name. But as Insider notes, it’s not all celebration
        back at Tesla headquarters. Instead, CEO Elon Musk made sure to warn drivers that the
        system still isn’t perfect — and that everyone needs to stay vigilant to make sure the
        experimental software doesn’t put them in harm’s way.</p>
        <p>“Running preproduction software is both work and fun,” Musk tweeted last week.
        “Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. Beta 9 addresses most
        known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid. Safety is
        always top priority at Tesla.”</p>

        <h4>Russia proposes nuclear power plant on Mars.</h4>
        <h6>Nations are racing ahead to be the first to establish a base on Mars.</h6></center>
        <br>
        <p>The concept of using nuclear power to build out our human presence in other parts of
        the solar system is as alive as it’s ever been.</p>
        <p>Case in point, a subsidiary of Russia’s Roscosmos space agency is now proposing a nuclear
        power station on Mars, intended to power a future Russian base on the Red Planet, state-run
        news agency Sputnik reports.</p>
        <p>The Arsenal Design Bureau, the subsidiary, is recommending using the same technologies
        destined for Zeus, a proposed interplanetary space tug, to power a nuclear reactor on the Martian
        surface as well.</p>
        <p>The massive space tug is designed to make use of a nuclear-powered electric propulsion system
        to deliver payloads throughout the solar system. Earlier this year, Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin
        suggested that Zeus could also visit other planets, including Jupiter, to search for alien life.
        Russia is hoping to begin flight-testing it starting around 2030.</p>
        <p>The Arsenal Design Bureau is now proposing using Zeus to send a separate nuclear power station
        to the Red Planet and have a parachute landing system lower it to the surface below.</p>
